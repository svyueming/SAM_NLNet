## Usage:

- ### Data preparation:

  In our code, we use the SAM model to pre-generate edge images to participate in the training of the model. You can refer to our code  [makeSAMmap.py](makeSAMmap.py)  to pre-generate edge images according to your own dataset. Please download the SAM pre-training model and place it in the corresponding folder.

- ### Train:

  You can train the model by running the  [train.py](train.py) . Before that please configure your model parameters.

- ### Test：

  You can test the model by running the [test.py](test.py) . Make sure that the model path and data path are set correctly.

  

We provide pre-trained models and test data at 0.2 sampling rate under pseudo-radial sampling. The download link is:
